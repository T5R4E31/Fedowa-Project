# Fedowa-Project
The first and solo Fedora remix for all of uwu peoples!

# Overview
The Fedowa Project is a student project (lol it's me) made to experiment with Fedora remix and all things
This project is based of the UwUntu project, but this time made for Fedora!
This project will be based of Fedora KDE desktop 

This Remix *should* have :
  - A nice and clean uwu theme
  - An alias instead of "dnf" (to decide)
  - Obviousely named "Fedowa" and have the nice Fedowa logo
  - Some possible additional packages like Latte Dock
